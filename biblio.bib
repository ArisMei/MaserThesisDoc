   abstract = {Bronchiolitis (BR), a lower respiratory tract infection mainly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can be very severe. Presently, adequate nutritional support and oxygen therapy remain the only interventions recommended to treat patients with BR. For years, mild BR cases were treated with noninvasive standard oxygen therapy (SOT), i.e., with cold and poorly or totally non-humidified oxygen delivered by an ambient headbox or low-flow nasal cannula. Children with severe disease were intubated and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). To improve SOT and overcome the disadvantages of IMV, new measures of noninvasive and more efficient oxygen administration have been studied. Bi-level positive air way pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) are among them. For its simplicity, good tolerability and safety, and the good results reported in clinical studies, HFNC has become increasingly popular and is now widely used. However, consistent guidelines for initiation and discontinuation of HFNC are lacking. In this narrative review, the role of HFNC to treat infants with BR is discussed. An analysis of the literature showed that, despite its widespread use, the role of HFNC in preventing respiratory failure in children with BR is not precisely defined. It is not established whether it can offer greater benefits compared to SOT and when and in which infants it can replace CPAP or BiPAP. The analysis of the results clearly indicates the need for multicenter studies and official guidelines. In the meantime, HFNC can be considered a safe and effective method to treat children with mild to moderate BR who do not respond to SOT.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine whether oral albuterol is effective in reducing symptomatology of acute viral bronchiolitis in infants with mild-to-moderate illness. Study design: In a randomized, double-blind trial, previously well infants were randomized upon discharge from the emergency department to receive either albuterol (0.1 mg/kg/dose) three times per day or placebo three times per day for 7 days. Daily standardized telephone interviews were conducted for as long as 14 days. The primary outcome was the time to resolution of illness. Secondary outcomes included time to normal feeding, normal sleeping, quiet breathing, resolved cough, and coryza. Results: We studied 129 infants (albuterol, n = 64; placebo, n = 65). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The overall mean age was 5.3 months, 60\% were male, and 49 of 61 tested infants were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The median (95\% confidence interval) time to resolution of illness (days) was similar: albuterol, 9.0 (8-13); placebo, 8.0 (7-9); P = .3) (log-rank test). There were no significant group differences in any secondary outcome. Health care revisit and admission rates were similar between groups. Conclusions: No significant group differences in either primary or secondary outcomes in infants treated with oral albuterol versus placebo were found. The widespread use of oral albuterol in this patient group is not recommended.},

   abstract = {Objective Analysis of longitudinal data can provide neonatologists with tools that can help predict clinical deterioration and improve outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze continuous monitoring data in newborns, using vital signs to develop predictive models for intensive care admission and time to discharge. Study Design We conducted a retrospective cohort study, including term and preterm newborns with respiratory distress patients admitted to the neonatal ward. Clinical and epidemiological data, as well as mean heart rate and saturation, at every minute for the first 12 hours of admission were collected. Multivariate mixed, survival and joint models were developed. Results A total of 56,377 heart rate and 56,412 oxygen saturation data were analyzed from 80 admitted patients. Of them, 73 were discharged home and 7 required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Longitudinal evolution of heart rate (p < 0.01) and oxygen saturation (p = 0.01) were associated with time to discharge, as well as birth weight (p < 0.01) and type of delivery (p < 0.01). Longitudinal heart rate evolution (p < 0.01) and fraction of inspired oxygen at admission at the ward (p < 0.01) predicted neonatal ICU (NICU) admission. Conclusion Longitudinal evolution of heart rate can help predict time to transfer to intensive care, and both heart rate and oxygen saturation can help predict time to discharge. Analysis of continuous monitoring data in patients admitted to neonatal wards provides useful tools to stratify risks and helps in taking medical decisions. Key Points Continuous monitoring of vital signs can help predict and prevent clinical deterioration in neonatal patients. In our study, longitudinal analysis of heart rate and oxygen saturation predicted time to discharge and intensive care admission. More studies are needed to prospectively prove that these models can helpmake clinical decisions and stratify patients' risks.},

Bronchiolitis patients may be treated with HFNC outside of the ICU with lower odds of failure. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:806-812. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
OBJECTIVES: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) use is increasing in pediatrics. Few studies exist examining the safety of HFNC use outside the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to characterize patient qualities associated with failure of HFNC use outside the ICU.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of patients placed on HFNC outside the ICU from September 2011 to July 2013 was completed. Failure was defined as intubation or cardiopulmonary arrest. Two-sample tests and binary logistic regression determined significant factors associated with failed HFNC administration, both unadjusted and adjusted for hospital.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-one patients met inclusion criteria, with 192 receiving treatment for a primary respiratory diagnosis (83)},

   abstract = {The use of the heated and humidified high-flow nasal cannula has become increasingly popular in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure through all age groups. This article will examine the main mechanisms of actions attributed to the use of the high-flow nasal cannula and review the indications in adult and pediatric populations (outside of the neonatal period). It is unclear which of the mechanisms of action is the most important, but it may depend on the cause of the patient's respiratory failure. This article describes the mechanism of action in an easy to remember mnemonic (HIFLOW); Heated and humidified, meets Inspiratory demands, increases Functional residual capacity (FRC), Lighter, minimizes Oxygen dilution, and Washout of pharyngeal dead space. We will also examine some of the main indications for its use in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The data for the use of high-flow nasal cannula is growing, and currently, some of the main adult indications include hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia, post-extubation, pre-oxygenation prior to intubation, acute pulmonary edema, and use in patients who are "do not resuscitate or intubate". The main pediatric indication is in infants with bronchiolitis, but other indications are being studied, such as its use in asthma, croup, pneumonia, transport of a critically ill child, and post-extubation.},
