   abstract = {Bronchiolitis (BR), a lower respiratory tract infection mainly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can be very severe. Presently, adequate nutritional support and oxygen therapy remain the only interventions recommended to treat patients with BR. For years, mild BR cases were treated with noninvasive standard oxygen therapy (SOT), i.e., with cold and poorly or totally non-humidified oxygen delivered by an ambient headbox or low-flow nasal cannula. Children with severe disease were intubated and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). To improve SOT and overcome the disadvantages of IMV, new measures of noninvasive and more efficient oxygen administration have been studied. Bi-level positive air way pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) are among them. For its simplicity, good tolerability and safety, and the good results reported in clinical studies, HFNC has become increasingly popular and is now widely used. However, consistent guidelines for initiation and discontinuation of HFNC are lacking. In this narrative review, the role of HFNC to treat infants with BR is discussed. An analysis of the literature showed that, despite its widespread use, the role of HFNC in preventing respiratory failure in children with BR is not precisely defined. It is not established whether it can offer greater benefits compared to SOT and when and in which infants it can replace CPAP or BiPAP. The analysis of the results clearly indicates the need for multicenter studies and official guidelines. In the meantime, HFNC can be considered a safe and effective method to treat children with mild to moderate BR who do not respond to SOT.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in children who are hospitalized should balance benefits of detecting deterioration with potential harms of alarm fatigue. We developed recommendations for monitoring outside the ICU on the basis of available evidence and expert opinion. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies addressing the utility of cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in common pediatric conditions and drafted candidate monitoring recommendations based on our findings. We convened a panel of nominees from national professional organizations with diverse expertise: nursing, medicine, respiratory therapy, biomedical engineering, and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness and necessity in 3 sequential rating sessions and a moderated meeting. RESULTS: The panel evaluated 56 recommendations for intermittent and continuous monitoring for children hospitalized outside the ICU with 7 common conditions (eg, asthma, croup) and/or receiving common therapies (eg, supplemental oxygen, intravenous opioids). The panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of monitoring recommendations for 55 of 56 indications and on necessity of monitoring for 52. For mild or moderate asthma, croup, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, the panel recommended intermittent vital sign or oximetry measurement only. The panel recommended continuous monitoring for severe disease in each respiratory condition as well as for a new or increased dose of intravenous opiate or benzodiazepine. CONCLUSIONS: Expert panel members agreed that intermittent vital sign assessment, rather than continuous monitoring, is appropriate management for a set of specific conditions of mild or moderate severity that require hospitalization. WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitors (commonly used to surveil for deterioration in children who are hospitalized) can negatively impact patient safety because of excessive monitor alarms. There are no national guidelines for using monitors in most common pediatric conditions. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Leveraging existing evidence, a national expert panel reached agreement that intermittent heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry assessment, rather than continuous monitoring, is appropriate management for a set of specific conditions of mild or moderate severity that require hospitalization.},

   abstract = {Acute respiratory failure represents one of the most common causes of intensive care unit admission and oxygen therapy remains the first-line therapy in the management of these patients. In recent years, high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula has been described as a useful alternative to conventional oxygen therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure. High-flow oxygen via nasal cannula rapidly alleviates symptoms of acute respiratory failure and improves oxygenation by several mechanisms, including dead space washout, reduction in oxygen dilution and inspiratory nasopharyngeal resistance, a moderate positive airway pressure effect that may generate alveolar recruitment and an overall greater tolerance and comfort with the interface and the heated and humidified inspired gases. However, the experience in adults is still limited and there are no clinical guidelines to establish recommendations for their use. This article aims to review the existing evidence on the use of high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula in adults with acute respiratory failure and its possible applications, advantages and limitations.},

   abstract = {Artículo de revisión La función respiratoria básica es el intercambio gaseoso de oxígeno y dióxido carbono; lo que implica un perfecto equilibrio y control entre los componentes del sistema respiratorio. Figura 1. Una falla en este proceso fundamental para la vida, es, en diferentes grados de intensidad, causa muy frecuente de solicitud de atenciones de salud, tanto prehospitalaria como hospitalaria. Por lo tanto es imprescindible aprender a reconocer rápidamente las circunstancias que la produjeron, así como también los síntomas y signos que encontramos en estos pacientes, de esta manera seremos capaces de una presunción diagnóstica rápida y atención inicial apropiada, aplicando inmediatamente las medidas de soporte básico y avanzado en forma eficiente a los pacientes con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda. DEFINICIÓN La insuficiencia respiratoria aguda (IRA) es la incapacidad del sistema respiratorio de cumplir su función básica, que es el intercambio gaseoso de oxígeno y dióxido de carbono entre el aire ambiental y la sangre circulante, ésta debe realizarse en forma eficaz y adecuada a las necesidades metabólicas del organismo, teniendo en cuenta la edad, los antecedentes y la altitud en que se encuentra el paciente. Entonces en la práctica, según Campbell: la insuficiencia respiratoria se define como la presencia de una hipoxemia arterial (PaO 2 menor de 60 mmHg), en reposo, a nivel del mar y respirando aire ambiental, acompañado o no de hipercapnia (PaCO 2 mayor de 45 mmHg). Denominaremos solo como hipoxemia cuando la PaO 2 se encuentre entre 60 y 80 mmHg 1, 2-4. En la atención prehospitalaria con guía de pulsioximetría, se pueden considerar que valores de Saturación de Oxígeno de 90\% a 95\% equivalen a PaO 2 de 60 a 80 mmHg (Hipoxemia) y si es de 90\% equivale a una PaO 2 de 60 mmHg (Insuficiencia Respiratoria). FISIOLOGÍA Como consecuencia inicial en la insuficiencia respiratoria pueden presentarse alteraciones en el nivel de oxígeno (O 2) y/o de anhídrido carbónico (CO 2), esto se explica por qué dentro del sistema respiratorio podemos distinguir en primer término los pulmones y su circulación, que es donde se realiza el intercambio gaseoso, su alteración produce hipoxemia con normocapnia o hipercapnia y en segundo término a la bomba que lo ventila que comprende la pared toráxica que incluye la pleura y el diafragma así como los músculos respiratorios y los componentes del sistema nervioso central y periférico, cuya disfunción produce hipoventilación que produce principalmente hipercapnea y en menor grado hipoxemia, además podemos identificar problemas en la vía aérea que pueden causar ambos tipos de situaciones. Describir la insuficiencia respiratoria como hipoxémica o hipercarbica provee alguna información acerca del déficit fisiológico que la produce, sin embargo, una mejor comprensión y reconocimiento de la fisiopatología, considerando individualmente cada uno de los componentes del sistema respiratorio que son requeridos para su funcionamiento fisiológico, nos permitiría una estrategia de diagnóstico y tratamiento 2, 5, 6. Fisiología de los componentes del sistema respiratorio Sistema Nervioso: Esto es el sistema de control, y comprende el núcleo dorsal y ventral del grupo de control medular respiratorio y sus nervios aferentes y eferentes asociados. Estos actúan de común acuerdo con la corteza cerebral para determinar frecuencia y esfuerzo respiratorio. RESUMEN La función respiratoria básica es el intercambio gaseoso de oxígeno y dióxido carbono; lo que implica un perfecto equilibrio y control entre los componentes del sistema respiratorio. a insuficiencia respiratoria aguda (IRA) es la incapacidad del sistema respiratorio de cumplir su función básica, que es el intercambio gaseoso de oxígeno y dióxido de carbono. Palabras clave: Insuficiencia respiratoria. ABSTRACT Basic respiratory function is gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which implies a perfect balance and control between the components of the respiratory system. acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the inability of the respiratory system to fulfill its basic function, which is the gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine whether oral albuterol is effective in reducing symptomatology of acute viral bronchiolitis in infants with mild-to-moderate illness. Study design: In a randomized, double-blind trial, previously well infants were randomized upon discharge from the emergency department to receive either albuterol (0.1 mg/kg/dose) three times per day or placebo three times per day for 7 days. Daily standardized telephone interviews were conducted for as long as 14 days. The primary outcome was the time to resolution of illness. Secondary outcomes included time to normal feeding, normal sleeping, quiet breathing, resolved cough, and coryza. Results: We studied 129 infants (albuterol, n = 64; placebo, n = 65). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The overall mean age was 5.3 months, 60\% were male, and 49 of 61 tested infants were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The median (95\% confidence interval) time to resolution of illness (days) was similar: albuterol, 9.0 (8-13); placebo, 8.0 (7-9); P = .3) (log-rank test). There were no significant group differences in any secondary outcome. Health care revisit and admission rates were similar between groups. Conclusions: No significant group differences in either primary or secondary outcomes in infants treated with oral albuterol versus placebo were found. The widespread use of oral albuterol in this patient group is not recommended.},

   abstract = {What is done with missing data? Does the missingness mechanism matter? Is it a good idea to just use the default options in the major statistical packages? Even some highly trained statisticians do this, so can the non-statistician analysing their own data cope with some of the better techniques for handling missing data? This paper shows how the mean and standard deviation are affected by different methods of imputation, given different missingness mechanisms. Better options than the standard default options are available in the major statistical software, offering the chance to 'do the right thing' to the statistical and non-statistical community alike. Introduction Missing data plagues almost all surveys, and quite a number of designed experiments. No matter how carefully an investigator tries to have all questions fully responded to in a survey, or how well designed an experiment is; examples of how this can occur are when a question is unanswered in a survey, or a flood has removed a crop planted close to a river. The problem is, how to deal with missing data, once it has been deemed impossible to recover the actual missing values. Traditional approaches include case deletion and mean imputation; (occasionally provided as an option with some software), These are the default for the major Statistical packages. In the last decade interest has centred on Regression Imputation, and Imputation of values using the EM (Expectation-Maximisation) algorithm, both of which will perform Single Imputation. More recently Multiple Imputation has become available, and is now being included as an option in the mainstream packages. Here I will look at eight different methods of imputation, and compare how well these methods perform (what happens to the means and standard deviations) under different missingness mechanisms with different amounts of missing data.},

   abstract = {Objective Analysis of longitudinal data can provide neonatologists with tools that can help predict clinical deterioration and improve outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze continuous monitoring data in newborns, using vital signs to develop predictive models for intensive care admission and time to discharge. Study Design We conducted a retrospective cohort study, including term and preterm newborns with respiratory distress patients admitted to the neonatal ward. Clinical and epidemiological data, as well as mean heart rate and saturation, at every minute for the first 12 hours of admission were collected. Multivariate mixed, survival and joint models were developed. Results A total of 56,377 heart rate and 56,412 oxygen saturation data were analyzed from 80 admitted patients. Of them, 73 were discharged home and 7 required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Longitudinal evolution of heart rate (p < 0.01) and oxygen saturation (p = 0.01) were associated with time to discharge, as well as birth weight (p < 0.01) and type of delivery (p < 0.01). Longitudinal heart rate evolution (p < 0.01) and fraction of inspired oxygen at admission at the ward (p < 0.01) predicted neonatal ICU (NICU) admission. Conclusion Longitudinal evolution of heart rate can help predict time to transfer to intensive care, and both heart rate and oxygen saturation can help predict time to discharge. Analysis of continuous monitoring data in patients admitted to neonatal wards provides useful tools to stratify risks and helps in taking medical decisions. Key Points Continuous monitoring of vital signs can help predict and prevent clinical deterioration in neonatal patients. In our study, longitudinal analysis of heart rate and oxygen saturation predicted time to discharge and intensive care admission. More studies are needed to prospectively prove that these models can helpmake clinical decisions and stratify patients' risks.},

OBJECTIVES: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) use is increasing in pediatrics. Few studies exist examining the safety of HFNC use outside the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to characterize patient qualities associated with failure of HFNC use outside the ICU.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of patients placed on HFNC outside the ICU from September 2011 to July 2013 was completed. Failure was defined as intubation or cardiopulmonary arrest. Two-sample tests and binary logistic regression determined significant factors associated with failed HFNC administration, both unadjusted and adjusted for hospital.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-one patients met inclusion criteria, with 192 receiving treatment for a primary respiratory diagnosis (83)},

It is unclear which of the mechanisms of action is the most important, but it may depend on the cause of the patient's respiratory failure.

We will also examine some of the main indications for its use in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The data for the use of high-flow nasal cannula is growing, and currently, some of the main adult indications include hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia, post-extubation, pre-oxygenation prior to intubation, acute pulmonary edema, and use in patients who are "do not resuscitate or intubate". The main pediatric indication is in infants with bronchiolitis, but other indications are being studied, such as its use in asthma, croup, pneumonia, transport of a critically ill child, and post-extubation.},

   abstract = {Objective Key components in the assessment of a child in the emergency department (ED) are their heart and respiratory rates. In order to interpret these signs, practitioners must know what is normal for a particular age. The aim of this paper is to develop age-specific centiles for these parameters and to compare centiles with the previously published work of Fleming and Bonafide, and the Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS) reference ranges. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study. Setting The ED of the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Australia. Patients Afebrile, Triage Category 5 (low priority) patients aged 0-15 years attending the ED. Interventions Centiles were developed using quantile regression analysis, with cubic B-splines to model the centiles. Main outcome measures Centile charts were compared with previous studies by concurrently plotting the estimates. Results 668 616 records were retrieved for ED attendances from 1995 to 2011, and 111 696 heart and respiratory rates were extracted for inclusion in the analysis. Graphical comparison demonstrates that with heart rate, our 50th centile agrees with the results of Bonafide, is considerably higher than the Fleming centiles and fits well between the APLS reference ranges. With respiratory rate, our 50th centile was considerably lower than the comparison centiles in infants, becomes higher with increasing age and crosses the lower APLS range in infants and upper range in teenagers. Conclusions Clinicians should consider adopting these centiles when assessing acutely unwell children. APLS should review their normal values for respiratory rate in infants and teenagers.},
